Object-oriented System Implementation
Bahria University requires a Learning Management System (LMS) to manage its academic
operations digitally. The system should support multiple roles, such as Admin, Instructor, and
Student, allowing them to perform actions like user registration, course creation, assignment
submission, grading, and feedback etc.
You are required to develop Bahria LMS, implementing all essential functionalities and are
encouraged to add extra features (such as discussion forums, attendance tracking,
notifications, etc as much as you can) to earn extra credit.
The project must be developed entirely using OOP principles and follow the Deitel-inspired
design-to-implementation process as described below.
